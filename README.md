## Terminologies

### StackOverflow, Question & Answer

StackOverflow is an industry-standard forum for posting programming related questions and getting crowd-sourced answers. A user posts a question under the user's account, and other users can contribute different answers as they see most appropriate per question. There are additional features on StackOverflow, such as upvoting the question or its corresponding answers. However, question and answer creation, retrieval and deletion are the most primitive.

### API / Endpoint

API and endpoint are often used interchangeably. They are the backend component that acts as the point of contact for frontend clients. Web APIs use the [HTTP protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) to exchange messages with frontend clients. The design of the APIs or endpoints determines how the frontend and backend communicate with one another.

### Model

Models describe how information is organized, transmitted or stored.

### Database / Storage / Persistence

Database, storage and persistence are often used interchangeably. They represent the component we use to store and access information for the application.

### CRUD & DAO

CRUD stands for actions of creation, read, update & deletion. DAO stands for data access object and is an interface in the application to perform these actions against the database.
